-     Hola mucho gusto. Mi nombre es Jenny, estoy estudiando desarrollo web. Actualmente aprendiendo español  :)
-     おはよ！ソヨンだよ- 前に日本のスタバで働いてたよー横浜に住んでた！今プログラミングを勉強している　:)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Marvel (Especially Guardians of the Galaxy and Eternals) , Game
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Java, JS, SQL and whatnot.. 
- :heart:
Starting web development on the backend with JAVA and I was struggling (In fact, not 'was' lol) with that so I’ve since focused my time on learning programming languages:sob: Currently I'm taking web-dev boot camp course (not exactly the same but kind of) so the class is extremely fast-paced for me, that being said, it confused me SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCHHHHH. I thought that programming is not my thing....  I was even weighing my options, to give up this course or not but I've decided not to give up. I know I'll keep running  into a lot of trouble to get used to programming languages but I'll do my best,  try to find my own way and overcome it as I've done so far.🙂

- :heart: 22/01/10 I've still been on the go these days for studying programming so always wear out.. locked in my room and don't even have time to air out !!! However the good thing is I finally started to sink in programming!!!! Uhh.. I have to go in on meeting since I have to turn in my final project til in the middle of Feb 🙂

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @didwpsl! My real name is soyoung yang but normally I go by Jenny especially when I'm with international friends :)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... Marvel (Especially Guardians of the Galaxy and Eternals) , Game
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Java, JS, SQL and whatnot.. 
- :heart:
Starting web development on the backend with JAVA and I was struggling (In fact, not 'was' lol) with that so Iâ€™ve since focused my time on learning programming languages:sob: Currently I'm taking web-dev boot camp course (not exactly the same but kind of) so the class is extremely fast-paced for me, that being said, it confused me SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCHHHHH. I thought that programming is not my thing....  I was even weighing my options, to give up this course or not but I've decided not to give up. I know I'll keep running  into a lot of trouble to get used to programming languages but I'll do my best,  try to find my own way and overcome it as I've done so far.ðŸ™‚
